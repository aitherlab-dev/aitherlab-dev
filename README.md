## Hey, I'm building something

I'm a videographer with zero programming background. At 47, I decided to build a real desktop application — entirely with AI.

**Claude GUI** — a native desktop client for Claude Code CLI.
Built with Tauri 2, React, and Rust. Every line of code written by Claude Opus, directed by me.

Multi-tab agent workflows, streaming responses, file editor, SQLite memory, voice input, MCP servers — the whole thing.

No bootcamps. No tutorials. Just a human and an AI, building in public.
