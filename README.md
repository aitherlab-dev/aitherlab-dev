## hey, i'm building something

i'm a videographer with zero programming background. at 47, i decided to build a real desktop application — entirely with AI.

**aither flow** — a native desktop client for Claude Code CLI.
built with Tauri 2, React, and Rust. every line of code written by Claude Opus, directed by me.

multi-tab agent workflows, streaming responses, file editor, SQLite memory, voice input, MCP servers — the whole damn thing.

no bootcamps. no tutorials. just a human and an AI, building in public.
