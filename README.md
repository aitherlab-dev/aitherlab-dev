Building my first IT project entirely with AI. My 10 years in video production taught me the most important thing: the Human is the point of accountability. AI is just a damn good tool. Every decision, every direction, every "ship it" — that's my call.

First project is solving my main pain — get Claude Code out of the terminal, keep everything it can do, but give it a proper face and extended functionality: multi-tab workflows for parallel tasks, streaming responses, a real file manager, clear session memory, native voice input, proper skills — and maybe more.

Built with Tauri 2, React, and Rust. Every line of code written by Claude Opus. No bootcamps. No tutorials. Just a human and an AI, building in public.
